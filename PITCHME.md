## {{Optimizing Development Workflow and Tooling}}
Help your future self!
+++

### What is your Workflow/Tooling
* Tools, Applications and Process that assist in code development

Note:
Think of the collection of: Tools, Applications and Process that you use to complete tasks 

+++ 

### Why should you Optimize your Workflow/Tooling
* Easier to integrate the use of new technologies
* Process of code development becomes easier/faster
* be prepared for the next "Big Thing" in software development 

Note: 
1 when your tools and workflow is Optimize using new technologies is easier
2 try to automate things we do daily (I have an example)
3 We should always be looking were the puck is going (not where the puck is)

+++
 ### Recommendations on how to Optimize your Workflow and Tooling 
 *  Try to identify parts of your "workflow" that could be optimized
 *  Can this part of the Workflow or tool be automated
 *  Investigate new features, plugins, add-ons in currently used apps  
 *  Search for alternative app that meets your needs

Note:
Here are a few broad recommendations  
---
## Examples

Note:
These are just a few examples, there are many more examples that I will not touch on

I want to stress that this part is more of a FYI these examples exist than I use an app over another

Have the mind set with  these example  of could help instead of should help

### Tying it Altogether

  #### Case :  When I write perl code I want to automatically lint (perltidy / perlcritic) the file(s) I was editing
  - first phase  : Run perltidy and perlcritic in a container like what is setup in bamboo
  - second phase : Create a git pre-commit hook that automatically runs container(perltidy and perlcritic) |
  - Third phase  : Replace hook with a text editor plugin that runs a container( perltidy and perlcritic) on saved |
 
 Note:
 Here is an example of use parts of the pervious examples and applying them to make my life eaiser

### Final Thoughts
* Does your "workflow" meet my current your needs ?
* What applications/process need to change 
* How to adapt your current "workflow" to meet your future needs
* Researching new apps/process that make your "workflow" easier

Note:

optimizing does not stop here with these examples it could be expanded to:

The way we program 
using libaraies to things
