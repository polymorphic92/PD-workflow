## {{Optimizing Development Workflow and Tooling}}
Help your future self!
+++

### What is your Workflow/Tooling
* Tools, Applications and Process that assist in code development

+++ 

### Why should you Optimize your Workflow/Tooling
* Easier to integrate  the use of new technologies
* Process of code development becomes easier/faster
* be prepared for the next "big thing" in software development 

+++
 ### Recommendations on how to Optimize your Workflow and Tooling 
 *  Try to identify parts of your "workflow" that could be optimized
 *  Can this part of the Workflow or tool be automated
 *  Investigate new features, plugins, add-ons in currently used apps  
 *  Search for alternative app that meets your needs

### Tying it Altogether
  #### Case :  When I write perl code I want to automatically lint (perltidy / perlcritic) the file(s) I was editing
  * first phase  : Run perltidy and perlcritic in a container like what is setup in bamboo
  * second phase : Create a git pre-commit hook that automatically runs container(perltidy and perlcritic)
  * Third phase  : Replace hook with a text editor plugin that runs a container( perltidy and perlcritic) on saved

---
### Final Thoughts
* Does your "workflow" meet my current your needs ?
* What applications/process need to change 
* How to adapt your current "workflow" to meet your future needs
* Researching new apps/process that make your "workflow" easier
